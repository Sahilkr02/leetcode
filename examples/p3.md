**Length of Longest Substring Without Repeating Characters**
===========================================================

This JavaScript function calculates the length of the longest substring without repeating characters in a given string `s`.

**Code**
```javascript
var lengthOfLongestSubstring = function (s) {
    let left = 0, maxLength = 0, charIndex = {};
    for (let right = 0; right < s.length; right++) {
        if (s[right] in charIndex) left = Math.max(left, charIndex[s[right]] + 1);
        charIndex[s[right]] = right;
        maxLength = Math.max(maxLength, right - left + 1);
    }
    return maxLength;
};
```

**Code Breakdown**
-----------------

### Variables and Data Structures

* `left`: The starting index of the current substring.
* `maxLength`: The maximum length of a substring without repeating characters found so far.
* `charIndex`: An object that stores the last seen index of each character in the string.

### Algorithm

1. Initialize `left` to 0, `maxLength` to 0, and `charIndex` as an empty object.
2. Iterate through the string `s` using a `for` loop with `right` as the index.
3. For each character `s[right]`:
	* If the character is already in `charIndex`, update `left` to the maximum of its current value and the index stored in `charIndex` plus 1. This ensures that the substring starting at `left` does not contain any repeating characters.
	* Update the index of the character in `charIndex` to the current `right` index.
	* Update `maxLength` to the maximum of its current value and the length of the current substring (`right - left + 1`).
4. Return `maxLength` after iterating through the entire string.

**Example Walkthrough**
----------------------

Suppose we call the function with the string `"abcabcbb"`.

1. Initialize `left` to 0, `maxLength` to 0, and `charIndex` as an empty object.
2. Iterate through the string:
	* `right` = 0, `s[right]` = `"a"`. `charIndex` is empty, so `left` remains 0. Update `charIndex` with `"a"` at index 0. `maxLength` becomes 1.
	* `right` = 1, `s[right]` = `"b"`. `charIndex` is empty for `"b"`, so `left` remains 0. Update `charIndex` with `"b"` at index 1. `maxLength` becomes 2.
	* `right` = 2, `s[right]` = `"c"`. `charIndex` is empty for `"c"`, so `left` remains 0. Update `charIndex` with `"c"` at index 2. `maxLength` becomes 3.
	* `right` = 3, `s[right]` = `"a"`. `charIndex` has `"a"` at index 0, so `left` becomes 1. Update `charIndex` with `"a"` at index 3. `maxLength` remains 3.
	* ...
3. After iterating through the entire string, `maxLength` is 3, which is the length of the longest substring without repeating characters (`"abc"`).

**Time and Space Complexity**
-----------------------------

* Time complexity: O(n), where n is the length of the input string, since we iterate through the string once.
* Space complexity: O(min(n, m)), where m is the size of the character set, since we store at most m characters in the `charIndex` object.
